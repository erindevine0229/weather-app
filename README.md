# Weather Dashboard Application

## Description
This web application is used to pull data from the Open Weather Map API regarding current weather and 5 day Forecast information for a given city which the user searches for. Fetch calls are used to obtain the desired data from this API and then local storage is used to give a search history functionality to the site. The history of user searches are saved as buttons on the left which can be used to re-display that weather data. 

Example display of weather forecast and search history buttons:

## Installation

## Usage
 To use the application, the client can use the search text box on the left side to enter in a desired city name. Once the search button is clicked, the current weather as well as the next 5 day weather forecast will be displayed. The city searched will then appear as a button underneath the search bar. A client can then search for additional cities and the links serve as a log. When clicking one of the buttons, the forecast will display the weather for that city again. It serves as a live search history.
